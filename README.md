## Sockets:

### Events

#### Backend

The backend listens to these events: 
- 'message': Takes the channelId and the content of the message in the dto. Message will be emited only to the users of that room.
- 'createChannel': Takes a name (optional), a type, a password (optional), a member list and an administrator list (both optional). Creates a channel with the given type and name, adds the specified users to the channel at its creation.
- 'joinChannel': Takes a channelId and a password (optional). Join the given channel.
- 'leaveChannel': Takes a channelId.
- 'addtoChannel': Takes a channelId and a userId. Only administrators can add someone to a channel.
- 'kickUser', 'banUser': Takes a channelId, userId and a reason (optional). Administrators can use admin actions on members and owner can use admin action on anyone. Emits a notification to the serv when an admin action was taken.
- 'muteUser': Takes a channelId, userId, a duration and a reason (optional). A muted user can't send messages to the given channel.
- 'makeAdmin': Takes a channelId and a userId. Only the owner can make someone else admin.
- 'updateChannel': Takes a type (optional) and/or a password (optional). If you're trying to make a channel protected by a password, a PROTECTED type is required else we'll throw an error

I added an 'addedtoChannel' event that will be emited to a user that has been newly added to a channel. Let me know if it is useful or not to allow the list of channels of a user to be updated.
Check the dtos in backend/src/chat/dto to see what the server is expecting to receive
